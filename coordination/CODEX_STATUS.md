### 2026-09-17 16:35 EDT — bdmap2 preflight complete; no benchmark launched yet

- Read `coordination/CLAUDE_STATUS.md`; Claude is using bdmap1 and reports no PanTS download or real `plans.json`, so I will not duplicate a dataset pull or its current Gate-0 baseline.
- Connected only to `bdmap2.wse.jhu.edu`. Required `~/pants-unetpp/unetpp_port/smoke_test.py` completed with `All smoke tests passed.`
- Node is idle: GB10 at 0% / 3 W with no GPU processes; 116 GiB OS memory available, swap currently 533 MiB used, `/home` has 602 GiB free. No tmux sessions or training/benchmark processes found.
- Environment observed: Python 3.10.21, PyTorch 2.10.0+cu130, CUDA 13.0, editable nnU-Net at `~/nnUNet`. PyTorch warns that this build advertises CUDA capability support through 12.0 while the GB10 reports 12.1; a tiny eager-CUDA probe is required before larger work.
- Safety discrepancy: server `~/pants-unetpp` is still commit `a876af0` with `origin=https://github.com/monkeylam/pants-unetpp.git`, not the authorized `aperson30` fork. I will preserve it and use a separate fork-backed checkout rather than repointing or overwriting it.
- `nnUNet_raw`, `nnUNet_preprocessed`, and `nnUNet_results` are unset in this login. No real-data benchmark can be claimed from the current node state.

### 2026-09-17 16:42 EDT — literature/reference-code audit complete; implementation deliberately deferred

- Re-read Claude's status after pulling commit `e88c2f4`: bdmap1 is unreachable; Claude moved its plain-U-Net synthetic benchmark to bdmap4. I remain exclusively on bdmap2 and will not duplicate that benchmark.
- The required smoke test passed, and a separate tiny eager CUDA Conv3d forward/backward probe also passed despite the capability warning (`[1, 8, 16, 32, 32]`, about 0.168 s, about 1 MiB allocated / 24 MiB reserved). This proves basic eager CUDA execution only, not representative training performance.
- Audited the published PGPS nnU-Net v2.6.2 branch and paper. The reference trainer changes more than patch size: it monkey-patches the instance-normalization spatial check, starts at the mathematical minimum patch, forces foreground oversampling to 0.5, enables keep-files-open, rebuilds augmenters at stage changes, and does not reserve 500-600 final full-patch epochs. Its Performance mode also changes batch size and reuses multiple crops per volume. We must not copy it verbatim.
- PanTS-safe PGPS design remains: physical batch 4, unchanged loss/optimizer/oversampling/augmentations, anatomical context floor, one-axis-at-a-time growth, and full patch reached by epoch 400-500. First measure the real step-time/patch-size curve; no long PGPS run or accuracy claim before the 500+ epoch tumor gate.
- Literature triage: checkpointing is a memory/capacity tool and reported about 30% runtime overhead in its foundational benchmark; bitsandbytes explicitly gives activation-heavy CNNs little benefit; FP8 Conv3d is not a drop-in PyTorch training path; DALI's reported 2x KiTS19 time-to-target combines data-pipeline speed with a convergence-changing tumor crop, while its BraTS example was about 5%; CUDA Graphs are distinct from torch.compile but should be a low-priority 1.00-1.10x hypothesis for this bandwidth-bound model.
- Revised safe order: full-vs-no-data diagnosis and worker/pinning/file-open sweep; dead-head equivalence + timing; sparse validation; fixed-batch patch-size curve; only then optional fused-SGD/CUDA-Graph microbenchmarks. No training code modified yet.
